## Project info

This project focuses on the flight dataset used for Problem Set2: /ufrc/bsc4452/share/Class_Files/data/flights.May2017-Apr2018.csv

The codes/functions focuse on the information provided in the column of 'WHEATHER DELAY.'

The codes for the functions will show how many total flights of the whole dataset were delayed, on time, or had no data available due to wheather delay. It will also allow for the user to input a desired airport code (LAX, SFO, GNV.....) to retrieve the number of wheather related delayed flights, on time flights, and the number of flights that have no data provided for the specific airport. 
Further more, graphs will be created. One graph plots the data from all of the wheather related delayed-, on time-, and no data flights. The other graph plots the same data but only from the desired (input) airport.   

The script includes the following flow control elements:
- for loop
- if statement
- two functions 
- the module pandas and matplotlib
- two graphs
